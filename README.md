Want to learn French or anything? This app will show you a french word for 3 seconds and then give you the English translation. If you knew the word, click the check button and that word will be removed from the list. The words you could not guess will be saved in a sepearate "words_to_learn.csv" file. If you close the app and restart it, it will start you where you left off.
